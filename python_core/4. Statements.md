# Statements

## PASS statement

#### In function

```python
def func(): pass
```

#### In a loop

```python
for x in [0, 1, 2]:
    pass
```

## Assignment statement

### Basic

#### Show basic form of assignment

```python
var = 'abc'

print(var)

> abc
```

### Sequence assignment

#### Show tuple and list assignment (positional)

```python
a, b = 1, 2
[c, d] = (3, 4)
e, f = {5: 'e', 6: 'f'} # Converts dictionary into list of keys

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)
print(e)
print(f)

> 1
> 2
> 3
> 4
> 5
> 6
```

#### Show sequence assignment

```python
a, b, c, d = 'abcd'

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)

> 1
> 2
> 3
> 4
```

```python
string = 'abc'
a, b, c = string

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

> a
> b
> c
```

#### Show nested sequence assignment

```python
((a, b), c) = ['ab', 'c']

print(a, b, c)

> a b c
```

#### How sequence assignment works with range

```python
a, b, c = range(3)

print(a, b, c)

> 0 1 2
```

### Extended unpacking

#### Show extended sequence unpacking (the rest of list)

With string:

```python
a, *b = 'abc'

print(a)
print(b)

> a
> ['b', 'c']
```

With dictionary:

```python
a, *b = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

print(a)
print(b)

> a
> ['b', 'c']
```

#### Show extended sequence unpacking in the beginning and in the middle of the list

```python
*a, b = 'abc'

print(a)
print(b)

> ['a', 'b']
> c
```

```python
a, *b, c = 'abcd'

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

> a
> ['b', 'c']
> d
```

#### Show if extended assignment might have less elements on the right side

```python
a, b, *c = 1, 2

print(a, b, c)

> 1 2 []
```

#### Show multiple-target assignment

```python
a = b = 'abcd'

print(a)
print(b)

> abcd
> abcd
```

#### What one should be aware of using mutuble types

```python
a = b = []
b.append(1)

print(a)

> [1]
```

### Augement Assignment

#### Show ariphmetical operations

Increment:

```python
x = 1
x += 3
print(x)
> 4

x -= 1
print(x)
> 3

x *= 5
print(x)
> 15

x /= 3
print(x)
> 5.0

x //= 2
print(x)
> 2.0

x **= 3
print(x)
> 8.0

x %= 5
print(x)
> 3.0
```

#### Show bitwice operations

```python
x = 0b101
x &= 0b110
print(bin(x))
> 0b100

x |= 0b010
print(bin(x))
> 0b110

x ^= 0b100
print(bin(x))
> 0b10

x <<= 3
print(bin(x))
> 0b10000

x >>= 3
print(bin(x))
> 0b10
```

#### How to switch value of two variables shortly?

```python
a = 1
b = 2
a, b = b, a

print(a, b)

> 2 1
```

#### Show how nested sequence assingment and extended assignment might be used in for loop calls

```python
for ((a, b), c) in [(('a', 'b'), 'c'), (('aa', 'bb'), 'cc')]:
    print(a, b, c)

> a b c
> aa bb cc
```

```python
for a, *b, c in ['abcd', 'klmno']:
    print(a, b, c)

> a ['b', 'c'] d
> k ['l', 'm', 'n'] o
```

## IF / ELSE statement

### Common Syntax

#### Show a general format of if statement

```python
if 3 < 2:
    print('False')
elif 3 < 5:
    print('True')
else:
    print('False')

> True
```

### Special Patterns

#### How to imitate SWITCH DEFAULT case with IF statement (3 ways)

With GET method of the list:

```python
cases = {
    1: 1.23,
    2: 2.34,
    3: 3.23
}
choice = 4
print(cases.get(choice, 0.01))

> 0.01
```

With IN statement:

```python
cases = {
    1: 1.23,
    2: 2.34,
    3: 3.23
}
choice = 4
if choice in cases:
    print(cases[choice])
else:
    print(0.01)

> 0.01
```

With TRY statement:

```python
cases = {
    1: 1.23,
    2: 2.34,
    3: 3.23
}
choice = 4
try:
    print(cases[choice])
except KeyError:
    print(0.01)

> 0.01
```

#### Imitate SWITCH with functions

```python
cases = {
    'multiplicate': lambda x, y: x * y,
    'divide': lambda x, y: x / y
}
default = lambda x, y: (x, y)
choice = 'divide'
result = cases.get(choice, default)()
print(result)

> 0.01
```

## IF / ELSE ternary expression

### lkjklj

#### Show common if/else ternary expression

```python
x = 5 if 4 > 2 else 8
print(x)

> 5

x = 5 if 4 > 2 else 8
print(x)

> 1
```

#### Show the same expression with AND / OR syntax hook (and show valnurabilities)

```python
x = ((4 < 2 and 5) or 8)
print(x)

> 8

x = ((4 < 2 and 5) or 8)
print(x)

> 8
```

But be careful with «... and False» part:

```python
x = ((4 < 2 and 0) or 8) # That's an error
print(x)

> 8
```

#### Make the same pattern with list

```python
x = [8, 5][4 > 2]
print(x)

> 5

x = [8, 5][4 < 2]
print(x)

> 8
```

#### How to assign first not empty element with OR operator

A = B = D = None
C = 4
x = A or B or C or D or None

print(x)
> 4
```

## WHILE LOOP statement

### Common Syntax

### Else, Break and Continue in WHILE LOOP

#### Will else be executed if while never did?

```python
while 5 < 0:
    print('while')
else:
    print('else')

> else
```

#### Show example of ELSE in WHILE LOOP

```python
x = 0
while x < 2:
    print(x)
    x += 1
else:
    print('Fin', x)
```

```python
x = 0
while x > 2:
    print(x)
    x += 1
else:
    print('Fin', x)

> Fin 0
```

#### How BREAK loop works, give an example?

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    x += 1
    if x == 3:
        break
    print(x)

> 1
> 2
```

#### How continue loop works, give an example?

```python
x = 0
while x < 5:
    x += 1
    if x == 3:
        continue
    print(x)

> 1
> 2
> 4
> 5
```

#### How to use assignment with WHILE LOOP (three patterns)?

```python
gen = (x for x in range(3))
while True:
    x = next(gen)
    if not x: break
    print('Loop', x)

```

```python
gen = (x for x in range(3))
x = True
while x:
    x = next(gen)
    if x:
        print('Loop', x)

```

```python
gen = (x for x in range(3))
x = next(gen)
while x:
    print('Loop', x)
    x = next(gen)

```

### Nested WHILE loop

#### How will break work in a nested loop?

```python
for x in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
    for y in [0, 5, 2, 6]:
        if x == y:
            print(y, 'was found')
            break
    else:
        print(x, 'wasn\'t found')

> 1 wasn't found
> 2 was found
> 3 wasn't found
> 4 wasn't found
```

### Special case with :=

```python
while x := func() > 10:
    print(x)
```

```python
import random

def func():
    return random.random()

while x := func() <= 0.9:
    print(x)
    
>>>
True
True
True
True
```

## FOR LOOP

### Bla-bla

#### Show the general format

```python
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(x)

> 1
> 2
> 3
```

#### What can be used in FOR loop as object

Any iterable object: string, list, tuple, dictionary, set?, generator:

Dictionary:

```python
for i in {'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}:
    print(i)

> a
> b
> c
```

Tuple:

```python
for i in ('a', 'b', 'c'):
    print(i)

> a
> b
> c
```

But be careful with **SET**:

```python
for i in {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}:
    print(i)

> c
> b
> d
> a
```

#### How to handle dictionary with keys and values (2 ways)

```python
for (key, val) in {'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}.items():
    print(key, '=>', val)

a => 1
b => 2
c => 3
```

```python
for (key, val) in {'a': '1', 'b': '2', 'c': '3'}.items():
    print(key, '=>', val)

a => 1
b => 2
c => 3
```

> 4
> Fin
```

        if x == y:
            print(y, 'was found')
            break
    else:
        print(x, 'wasn\'t found')

> 1 wasn't found
> 2 was found
> 3 wasn't found
> 4 wasn't found
```

## LOOP CODING TECHNIQUES

### RANGE

#### Give an example of loop with range

Use range in a classic for i loop (from number to number)

```python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)

> 0
> 1
> 2
```

### ZIP

#### Give an example of ZIP usage in for loop

```python
S = 'abc'
N = [1, 2, 3]

for (x, y) in zip(S, N):
    print(x, y)

> a 1
> b 2
> c 3
```

### ENUMERATE

```python
S = 'abc'

for (index, x) in enumerate(S):
    print(index, x)

> 0 a
> 1 b
> 2 c
```
